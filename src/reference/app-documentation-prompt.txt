Alright. We have completed creating the web application for itinerary generation. Now I need a detailed report about this product. Here are the details

Name: Travel Itinerary Generator
Summary: Creates a travel itinerary based on the below user inputs
Title
Destination
Traveller Name
Pax
Start Date
End Date
Day wise plan
Cost details
Inclusions
Exclusions

The app takes the above input and create a details pdf with the below

Title page with title, dates, traveller name and pax
Day wise plan details with highlights, travel tips and local experience
Packaging checklist
Summary and contact

Security features:
Watermark of company logo on all pages
Watermark travel icons in random places in all pages
Barcode in summary and contact page to keep track of itinerary

App details:
The trip details and the pdf data (in binary) are stored in mongo db
And the chatgpt response for the trip is stored in redis for 2 months (If the user gives the same input, then the pdf will be created from the existing cache in redis instead of using the chatgpt token)
App also has the option to disable cache, in which case, the redis cache for the input is first deleted and then new response is generated using the chatgpt token and the new response is also stored in redis

Technical Stack:
Frontend: Astrojs with React components from shadcn and tailwind css
Backend: Nestjs with GraphQL. Mongo db to store trip details that comes as request from frontend. Creates trip in mongodb and also transforms the user input to input that could be sent to python script which generates the pdf
Itinerary Generator: Python script that takes in request data (from backend) and uses that data to generate a details chatgpt response (if not available already in cache/redis or user disabled cache) which is then further parsed based on the chatgpt output format to fill in the details in pdf. Once the pdf is created, the binary of pdf is then stored in mongodb and the newly created id of the pdf record is sent as response (to backend)
Db Optimizer (optional): Python script that runs every scheduled period of time (based on user need) which clears db whenever the space is closed to free quota limits and deletes the old records

Give me a professional report which I can use to share to travel agencies and enterprises
